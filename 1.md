When a team led by Marzieh Moeenfard of the University of Porto looked more closely, they found that the potential benefits ran deeper. She reported in the Journal of Cellular Biochemistry in 2016 that cafestol and kahweol (which tend to be more prevalent in unfiltered than in filtered coffee) arrested tumour growth by making it less likely that new blood vessels would form around tumour cells,and that chlorogenic acids inhibited the formation of carcinogens within the body.This suggested coffee might be good forfending off cancer.

波尔图大学的玛尔齐耶.莫恩法德(Marzieh Moeenfard)带领团队进行了更深入的研究，他们发现咖啡的潜在益处可能更为深远。她在2016年的<<细胞生物化学杂志>>上报告称，咖啡豆醇和咖啡白脂(未过滤咖啡中含量通常高于过滤咖啡)可以通过降低肿瘤细胞周围形成新血管的可能性来抑制肿瘤生长，而绿原酸 则可以抑制体内致癌物质的形成。这表明咖啡可能有助于预防癌症。

One follow-up study led byJin-Kvoung Oh of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm reported that post-menopausal women who claimed to drink three or four cups of coffee per day were significantly less likely to develop breast cancer than women who said they drank up to two cups. Similar work in Japan suggested that those who said they drank three or more cups every day had a reduced risk of developing liver cancer.

喝三到四杯咖啡的绝经后女性，她们患乳腺癌的险明显低于每天只喝不超过两杯咖啡的女性。日本的一项
类似研究表明，声称每天喝三杯或更多咖啡的人患肝癌的风险有所降低。
