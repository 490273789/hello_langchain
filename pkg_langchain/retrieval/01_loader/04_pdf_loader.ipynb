We propose Reflexion, a\\nnovel framework to reinforce language agents not by updating weights, but in-\\nstead through linguistic feedback. Concretely, Reflexion agents verbally reflect\\non task feedback signals, then maintain their own reflective text in an episodic\\nmemory buffer to induce better decision-making in subsequent trials. Reflexion is\\nflexible enough to incorporate various types (scalar values or free-form language)\\nand sources (external or internally simulated) of feedback signals, and obtains\\nsignificant improvements over a baseline agent across diverse tasks (sequential\\ndecision-making, coding, language reasoning).

Reflexion converts binary or scalar feedback from the\\nenvironment into verbal feedback in the form of a textual summary, which is then added as additional\\ncontext for the LLM agent in the next episode. This self-reflective feedback acts as a ‘semantic’\\ngradient signal by providing the agent with a concrete direction to improve upon, helping it learn\\nfrom prior mistakes to perform better on the task. This is akin to how humans iteratively learn to\\naccomplish complex tasks in a few-shot manner – by reflecting on their previous failures in order to\\nform an improved plan of attack for the next attempt. For example, in figure 1, a Reflexion agent\\nlearns to optimize its own behavior to solve decision-making, programming, and reasoning tasks\\nthrough trial, error, and self-reflection.\\nGenerating useful reflective feedback is challenging since it requires a good understanding of where\\nthe model made mistakes (i.e. the credit assignment problem [25]) as well as the ability to generate\\na summary containing actionable insights for improvement. We explore three ways for doing\\nthis – simple binary environment feedback, pre-defined heuristics for common failure cases, and\\nself-evaluation such as binary classification using LLMs (decision-making) or self-written unit\\ntests (programming). In all implementations, the evaluation signal is amplified to natural language\\nexperience summaries which can be stored in long-term memory.\\nReflexion has several advantages compared to more traditional RL approaches like policy or value-\\nbased learning: 1) it is lightweight and doesn’t require finetuning the LLM, 2) it allows for more\\nnuanced forms of feedback (e.g. targeted changes in actions), compared to scalar or vector rewards\\nthat are challenging to perform accurate credit assignment with, 3) it allows for a more explicit and\\ninterpretable form of episodic memory over prior experiences, and 4) it provides more explicit hints\\nfor actions in future episodes. At the same time, it does have the disadvantages of relying on the\\npower of the LLM’s self-evaluation capabilities (or heuristics) and not having a formal guarantee for\\nsuccess. However, as LLM capabilities improve, we only expect this paradigm to get better over time.\\nWe perform experiments on (1) decision-making tasks to test sequential action choices over long\\ntrajectories, (2) reasoning tasks to test knowledge-intensive, single-step generation improvement,\\nand (3) programming tasks to teach the agent to effectively use external tools such as compilers\\nand interpreters. Across all three types of tasks, we observe Reflexion agents are better decision-\\nmakers, reasoners, and programmers. More concretely, Reflexion agents improve on decision-making\\nAlfWorld [24] tasks over strong baseline approaches by an absolute 22% in 12 iterative learning\\nsteps, and on reasoning questions in HotPotQA [28] by 20%, and Python programming tasks on\\nHumanEval [6] by as much as 11%.\\nTo summarize, our contributions are the following:\\n• We propose Reflexion, a new paradigm for ‘verbal‘ reinforcement that parameterizes a\\npolicy as an agent’s memory encoding paired with a choice of LLM parameters.\\n• We explore this emergent property of self-reflection in LLMs and empirically show that\\nself-reflection is extremely useful to learn complex tasks over a handful of trials.\\n• We introduce LeetcodeHardGym, a code-generation RL gym environment consisting of 40\\nchallenging Leetcode questions (‘hard-level‘) in 19 programming languages.\\n• We show that Reflexion achieves improvements over strong baselines across several tasks,\\nand achieves state-of-the-art results on various code generation benchmarks.\\n2\\nRelated work\\nReasoning and decision-making\\nSelf-Refine [15] employs an iterative framework for self-\\nrefinement to autonomously improve generation through self-evaluation. These self-evaluation\\nand self-improvement steps are conditioned on given task constraints, such as \"How can this genera-\\ntion be written in a more positive way\". Self-Refine is effective but is limited to single-generation\\nreasoning tasks. Pryzant et al. [21] performs a similar semantic prompt-writing optimization, but is\\nalso limited to single-generation tasks. Paul et al. [20] fine-tune critic models to provide intermediate\\nfeedback within trajectories to improve reasoning responses. Xie et al.

Analogous to traditional\\npolicy-based RL setups, we sample an action or generation, at, from the current policy πθ at time t,\\nreceive an observation from the environment ot. We explore various Actor models, including Chain of\\nThought [26] and ReAct [30]. These diverse generation models allow us to explore different aspects\\nof text and action generation within the Reflexion framework, providing valuable insights into their\\nperformance and effectiveness. In addition, we also add a memory component mem that provides\\nadditional context to this agent. This adaption was inspired by Brooks et al. [3], who suggest a policy\\niteration approach using in-context learning. Details on how this is populated are provided below.\\nEvaluator\\nThe Evaluator component of the Reflexion framework plays a crucial role in assessing\\nthe quality of the generated outputs produced by the Actor. It takes as input a generated trajectory\\nand computes a reward score that reflects its performance within the given task context. Defining\\neffective value and reward functions that apply to semantic spaces is difficult, so we investigate\\nseveral variants of the Evaluator model. For reasoning tasks, we explore reward functions based\\non exact match (EM) grading, ensuring that the generated output aligns closely with the expected\\nsolution. In decision-making tasks, we employ pre-defined heuristic functions that are tailored to\\nspecific evaluation criteria. Additionally, we experiment with using a different instantiation of an\\nLLM itself as an Evaluator, generating rewards for decision-making and programming tasks. This\\nmulti-faceted approach to Evaluator design allows us to examine different strategies for scoring\\ngenerated outputs, offering insights into their effectiveness and suitability across a range of tasks.\\nSelf-reflection\\nThe Self-Reflection model instantiated as an LLM, plays a crucial role in the\\nReflexion framework by generating verbal self-reflections to provide valuable feedback for future\\ntrials. Given a sparse reward signal, such as a binary success status (success/fail), the current trajectory,\\nand its persistent memory mem, the self-reflection model generates nuanced and specific feedback.\\nThis feedback, which is more informative than scalar rewards, is then stored in the agent’s memory\\n(mem). For instance, in a multi-step decision-making task, when the agent receives a failure signal, it\\ncan infer that a specific action ai led to subsequent incorrect actions ai+1 and ai+2. The agent can\\nthen verbally state that it should have taken a different action, a′\\ni, which would have resulted in a′\\ni+1\\nand a′\\ni+2, and store this experience in its memory. In subsequent trials, the agent can leverage its past\\nexperiences to adapt its decision-making approach at time t by choosing action a′\\ni. This iterative\\nprocess of trial, error, self-reflection, and persisting memory enables the agent to rapidly improve its\\ndecision-making ability in various environments by utilizing informative feedback signals.\\nMemory\\nCore components of the Reflexion process are the notion of short-term and long-term\\nmemory. At inference time, the Actor conditions its decisions on short and long-term memory, similar\\n4'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2023-10-11T00:21:22+00:00', 'source': '../datas/Reflexion.pdf', 'file_path': '../datas/Reflexion.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2023-10-11T00:21:22+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20231011002122Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20231011002122Z', 'page': 4}, page_content='to the way that humans remember fine-grain recent details while also recalling distilled important\\nexperiences from long-term memory. In the RL setup, the trajectory history serves as the short-term\\nmemory while outputs from the Self-Reflection model are stored in long-term memory. These two\\nmemory components work together to provide context that is specific but also influenced by lessons\\nlearned over several trials, which is a key advantage of Reflexion agents over other LLM action\\nchoice works.\\nThe Reflexion process\\nReflexion is formalized as an iterative optimization process in 1. In the\\nfirst trial, the Actor produces a trajectory τ0 by interacting with the environment. The Evaluator then\\nproduces a score r0 which is computed as rt = Me(τ0). rt is only a scalar reward for trial t that\\nimproves as task-specific performance increases. After the first trial, to amplify r0 to a feedback form\\nthat can be used for improvement by an LLM, the Self-Reflection model analyzes the set of {τ0, r0}\\nto produce a summary sr0 which is stored in the memory mem. srt is a verbal experience feedback\\nfor trial t. The Actor, Evaluator, and Self-Reflection models work together through trials in a loop\\nuntil the Evaluator deems τt to be correct. As mentioned in 3, the memory component of Reflexion\\nis crucial to its effectiveness. After each trial t, srt, is appended mem. In practice, we bound mem\\nby a maximum number of stored experiences, Ω(usually set to 1-3) to adhere to max context LLM\\nlimitations.\\n4\\nExperiments\\nWe evaluate various natural language RL setups on decision-making, reasoning, and code generation\\ntasks. Specifically, we challenge an agent to perform search-based question answering on HotPotQA\\n[28], multi-step tasks in common household environments in AlfWorld [24], and code writing tasks\\nin competition-like environments with interpreters and compilers in HumanEval [6], MBPP [2],\\nand LeetcodeHard, a new benchmark. Most notably, Reflexion improves performance over strong\\nbaselines by 22% in AlfWorld, 20% in HotPotQA, and 11% on HumanEval.\\n4.1\\nSequential decision making: ALFWorld\\nAlfWorld is a suite of text-based environments that challenge an agent to solve multi-step tasks\\nin a variety of interactive environments based on TextWorld [8]. Following Yao et al. [30], we\\nrun the agent in 134 AlfWorld environments across six different tasks, including finding hidden\\nobjects (e.g., finding a spatula in a drawer), moving objects (e.g., moving a knife to the cutting\\nboard), and manipulating objects with other objects (e.g., chilling a tomato in the fridge). We use\\nReAct [30] as the action generator as Yao et al. [30] has shown success in long trajectory decision-\\nmaking using explicit intermediate thoughts. AlfWorld tasks naturally require a self-evaluation step\\nas the environment can only signal if a task is complete. To achieve fully autonomous behavior,\\nwe implement two self-evaluation techniques: natural language classification using an LLM and a\\nhand-written heuristic. The heuristic is simple: if the agent executes the same action and receives the\\nsame response for more than 3 cycles, or if the number of actions taken in the current environment\\nexceeds 30 (inefficient planning), we self-reflect. In the baseline runs, if self-reflection is suggested,\\nwe skip the self-reflection process, reset the environment, and start a new trial. In the Reflexion runs,\\nthe agent uses self-reflection to find its mistake, update its memory, reset the environment, and start a\\nnew trial. To avoid very long prompt windows that may exceed the maximum limit, we truncate the\\nagent’s memory to the last 3 self-reflections (experiences).\\nTo avoid syntactic errors, we provide two domain-specific few-shot trajectories to the agent. We use\\nthe same few-shot trajectory examples as Yao et al. [30] with GPT-3 for the LLM.

There are two main cases in which\\nlong-term memory helps an agent in AlfWorld: 1) An early mistake in a long trajectory can be easily\\nidentified. The agent can suggest a new action choice or even a new long-term plan. 2) There are too\\nmany surfaces/containers to check for an item. The agent can exploit its experience memory over\\nseveral trials to thoroughly search a room. In 3, the learning curve suggests that the learning process\\noccurs over several experiences, meaning that the agent is successfully balancing cases 1 and 2 shown\\nin the immediate spike in the improvement between the first two trials, then a steady increase over\\nthe next 11 trials to a near-perfect performance. On the other hand, 3 shows a ReAct-only agent\\nconverging at a hallucination rate of 22% with no signs of long-term recovery.\\n4.2\\nReasoning: HotpotQA\\nHotPotQA [28] is a Wikipedia-based dataset with 113k question-and-answer pairs that challenge\\nagents to parse content and reason over several supporting documents. To test improvement in\\nreasoning only ability, we implement Reflexion + Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [26] for step-by-step\\nQ →A and Q, Cgt →A implementations, where Q is the question, Cgt is the ground truth context\\nfrom the dataset, and A is the final answer. Since CoT is not a multi-step decision-making technique,\\nwe give Cgt to the agent so that we can isolate the reasoning behavior over large sections of the\\nprovided text. To test holistic question and answering ability, which requires reasoning and action\\nchoice, we implement a Reflexion + ReAct [30] agent that can retrieve relevant context using a\\nWikipedia API and infer answers using step-by-step explicit thinking. For CoT implementations, we\\nuse 6-shot prompting; for ReAct, we use 2-shot prompting, and for self-reflection, we use 2-shot\\nprompting. All examples can be found in the appendix.\\nRobustly evaluating natural language answers is a long-standing problem in NLP. Therefore, between\\ntrials, we use exact match answer grading using the environment to give a binary success signal to\\nthe agent. After each trial, the self-reflection loop is employed to amplify the binary signal, similar to\\nthe decision-making setup 4.1 in AlfWorld with a memory size of 3 experiences.\\nResults\\nReflexion outperforms all baseline approaches by significant margins over several learning\\nsteps. Furthermore, ReAct-only, CoT-only, and CoT (GT)-only implementations fail to probabilisti-\\ncally improve on any tasks, meaning that no failed tasks from the first trial from any of the baseline\\napproaches were able to be solved in subsequent trials using a temperature of 0.7 In the Reflexion runs,\\nwe allowed the agent to gather experience and retry on failed tasks until it produced 3 consecutive\\nfailed attempts on the particular task. Naturally, the CoT (GT) achieved higher accuracy scores as it\\nwas given access to the ground truth context of the question. Still, the CoT (GT) agent is unable to\\ncorrectly infer the correct answer for 39% of the questions, but Reflexion helps the agent to correct\\nits mistakes without access to the ground truth answer to improve its accuracy by 14%.\\n6'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2023-10-11T00:21:22+00:00', 'source': '../datas/Reflexion.pdf', 'file_path': '../datas/Reflexion.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2023-10-11T00:21:22+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20231011002122Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20231011002122Z', 'page': 6}, page_content='0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\nTrial Number\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\nProportion of Solved Tasks\\n(a) HotPotQA Success Rate\\nCoT only\\nReAct only\\nCoT + Reflexion\\nReAct + Reflexion\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\nTrial Number\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1.0\\nProportion of Solved Tasks\\n(b) HotPotQA CoT (GT)\\nCoT (GT) only\\nCoT (GT) + Reflexion\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nTrial Number\\n0.5\\n0.6\\n0.7\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n1.0\\nProportion of Solved Tasks\\n(c) HotPotQA Episodic Memory\\nCoT (GT) only\\nCoT (GT) EPM\\nCoT (GT) EPM + Reflexion\\nFigure 4: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReAct.

Recall that CoT (GT) uses Chain-of-Thought\\nreasoning with provided ground truth context, which tests reasoning ability over long contexts. Next,\\nwe add an element of episodic memory (EPM) by including the most recent trajectory. For the\\nReflexion agent, we implement the standard self-reflection step as a final pass. Intuitively, we test if\\nthe agent is iteratively learning more effectively by using verbal explanation using language written\\nin the first person. 4 shows that self-reflection improves learning by an 8% absolute boost over\\nthe episodic memory learning advantage. This result supports the argument that refinement-only\\napproaches are not as effective as self-reflection-guided refinement approaches.\\n4.3\\nProgramming\\nWe evaluate the baseline and Reflexion approaches on Python and Rust code writing on MBPP\\n[2], HumanEval [6], and LeetcodeHardGym, our new dataset. MBPP and HumanEval measure\\nfunction body generation accuracy given natural language descriptions. We use a benchmark language\\ncompiler, MultiPL-E [4], to translate subsets of HumanEval and MBPP to the Rust language. MultiPL-\\nE is a collection of small compilers that can be used to translate Python benchmark questions to 18\\nother languages. We include experiments for Rust code generation to demonstrate that Reflexion\\nimplementations for code generation are language-agnostic and can be used for interpreted and\\ncompiled languages. Lastly, we introduce a new benchmark, LeetcodeHardGym, which is an\\ninteractive programming gym that contains 40 Leetcode hard-rated questions that have been released\\nafter October 8, 2022, which is the pre-training cutoff date of GPT-4 [18].\\nThe task of programming presents a unique opportunity to use more grounded self-evaluation practices\\nsuch as self-generated unit test suites. Thus, our Reflexion-based programming task implementation is\\neligible for pass@1 accuracy reporting. To generate a test suite, we use Chain-of-Thought prompting\\n[26] to produce diverse, extensive tests with corresponding natural language descriptions. Then, we\\nfilter for syntactically valid test statements by attempting to construct a valid abstract syntax tree\\n(AST) for each proposed test. Finally, we sample n tests from the collection of generated unit tests\\nto produce a test suite T, denoted as {t0, t1, . . . , tn}. We set n to a maximum of 6 unit tests. Aside\\nfrom the unit test suite component, the setup for the learning loop for a Reflexion programming agent\\nis identical to the reasoning and decision-making agents with a max memory limit of 1 experience.\\nBenchmark + Language\\nPrev SOTA Pass@1\\nSOTA Pass@1\\nReflexion Pass@1\\nHumanEval (PY)\\n65.8 (CodeT [5] + GPT-3.5)\\n80.1 (GPT-4)\\n91.0\\nHumanEval (RS)\\n–\\n60.0 (GPT-4)\\n68.0\\nMBPP (PY)\\n67.7 (CodeT [5] + Codex [6])\\n80.1 (GPT-4)\\n77.1\\nMBPP (RS)\\n–\\n70.9 (GPT-4)\\n75.4\\nLeetcode Hard (PY)\\n–\\n7.5 (GPT-4)\\n15.0\\nTable 1: Pass@1 accuracy for various model-strategy-language combinations.

We further investigate the inferior\\nperformance of Reflexion on MBPP Python.\\nAnalysis\\nWe acknowledge that self-reflecting code-generation agents are bound to their ability to\\nwrite diverse, comprehensive tests. Therefore, in the case in which the model generates a flaky test\\nsuite, it is possible that all tests pass on an incorrect solution and lead to a false positive label on a\\ncode completion [11]. On the other hand, if the model produces an incorrectly written test suite, it\\nis possible for some of the tests to fail on a correct solution, leading to a self-reflection generation\\nthat is conditioned on a false negative code completion. Given the implementation of Reflexion,\\nfalse negatives are preferred over false positives as the agent may be able to use self-reflection to\\nidentify the incorrect test(s) and prompt itself to keep the original code completion intact. On the\\nother hand, if an invalid test suite returns a false positive completion (all internal test cases pass\\nbut the implementation is incorrect), the agent will prematurely report an invalid submission. In 2,\\nvarious conditions are measured to analyze performance beyond pass@1 accuracy. Previously, we\\ndisplayed the inferior performance of Reflexion to the baseline GPT-4 on MBPP Python. In 2, we\\nobserve a notable discrepancy between the false positive labels produced by internal test execution,\\nP(not pass@1 generation correct | tests pass). That is, the probability that a submission will fail given\\nthat it passes all unit tests. For HumanEval and MBPP Python, the baseline pass@1 accuracies are\\nrelatively similar, 82% and 80%, respectively. However, the false positive test execution rate for\\nMBPP Python is 16.3% while the rate for HumanEval Python is a mere 1.4%, leading to 91% overall\\naccuracy 1.\\nApproach\\nTest Generation\\nSelf-reflection\\nPass@1 (Acc)\\nBase model\\nFalse\\nFalse\\n0.60\\nTest generation omission\\nFalse\\nTrue\\n0.52\\nSelf-reflection omission\\nTrue\\nFalse\\n0.60\\nReflexion\\nTrue\\nTrue\\n0.68\\nTable 3: Pass@1 accuracy for various compromised approaches on the Reflexion approach using\\nGPT-4 as the base model on HumanEval Rust - 50 hardest problems\\nAblation study\\nWe test the composite approach of Reflexion for test generation and self-reflection\\ncooperation on a subset of the 50 hardest HumanEval Rust problems. Our Rust compiler environment\\nprovides verbose error logs and helpful debugging hints, therefore serving as a good playground\\nfor compromised approaches. First, we omit internal test generation and execution steps, which\\ntest the agent to self-reflect without guidance from current implementations. 3 shows an inferior\\n52% vs 60% (baseline) accuracy, which suggests that the agent is unable to determine if the current\\nimplementation is correct without unit tests. Therefore, the agent must participate in all iterations of\\nthe run without the option to return early, performing harmful edits to the implementation.\\nNext, we test self-reflection contribution by omitting the natural language explanation step following\\nfailed unit test suite evaluations. Intuitively, this challenges the agent to combine the tasks of\\nerror identification and implementation improvement across all failed unit tests. Interestingly, the\\ncompromised agent does not improve performance over the baseline run. We observe that the test\\ngeneration and code compilation steps are able to catch syntax and logic errors, but the implementation\\nfixes do not reflect these indications.

In this study, we limit long-term memory to\\na sliding window with maximum capacity, but we encourage future work to extend the memory\\ncomponent of Reflexion with more advanced structures such as vector embedding databases or\\ntraditional SQL databases. Specific to code generation, there are many practical limitations to test-\\ndriven development in specifying accurate input-output mappings such as non-deterministic generator\\nfunctions, impure functions that interact with APIs, functions that vary output according to hardware\\nspecifications, or functions that invoke parallel or concurrent behavior that may be difficult to predict.\\n6\\nBroader impact\\nLarge language models are increasingly used to interact with external environments (e.g. the Internet,\\nsoftware, robotics, etc.) and humans. Our work has the potential of reinforcing and empowering\\nthese agents toward greater automation and work efficiency, but it also amplifies the risks when these\\nagents were put into misuse. We believe that this direction of research will need more effort in safety\\nand ethical considerations.\\nOn the other hand, reinforcement learning has suffered from its black-box policy and optimiza-\\ntion setups in which interpretability and alignment have been challenging. Our proposed “verbal”\\nreinforcement learning might address some of the issues and turn autonomous agents more inter-\\npretable and diagnosable. For example, in the case of tool-usage that may be too hard for humans to\\nunderstand, self-reflections could be monitored to ensure proper intent before using the tool.\\n7\\nConclusion\\nIn this work, we present Reflexion, an approach that leverages verbal reinforcement to teach agents\\nto learn from past mistakes. We empirically show that Reflexion agents significantly outperform\\ncurrently widely-used decision-making approaches by utilizing self-reflection. In future work,\\nReflexion could be used to employ more advanced techniques that have been thoroughly studied in\\ntraditional RL settings, such as value learning in natural language or off-policy exploration techniques.\\n8\\nReproducibility\\nWe highly advise others to use isolated execution environments when running autonomous code\\nwriting experiments as the generated code is not validated before execution.\\n9'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2023-10-11T00:21:22+00:00', 'source': '../datas/Reflexion.pdf', 'file_path': '../datas/Reflexion.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2023-10-11T00:21:22+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20231011002122Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20231011002122Z', 'page': 9}, page_content='References\\n[1] Ahn, M., Brohan, A., Brown, N., Chebotar, Y., Cortes, O., David, B., Finn, C., Gopalakrishnan,\\nK., Hausman, K., Herzog, A., et al.

We observe this shortcoming in an experiment on WebShop [29].\\nWebShop is a web-based problem-solving benchmark that tests agents to navigate an e-commerce\\nwebsite to locate and purchase products given requests from clients. We test a two-shot ReAct +\\nReflexion agent in 100 environments. However, after only four trials, we terminate the runs as the\\nagent does not show signs of improvement 6. Further, the agent does not generate helpful, intuitive\\nself-reflections after failed attempts. We conclude that Reflexion is unable to solve tasks that require\\na significant amount of diversity and exploration. In AlfWorld, the agent is able to adequately explore\\nnew environments because the permissible actions can be seen in the observations. In HotPotQA,\\nthe agent faces a similar WebShop search query task but is more successful as the search space for\\nWikipedia articles is more diverse and requires less precise search queries. A common problem for\\ne-commerce search engines is properly handling ambiguity in natural language search interpretations.\\nThus, WebShop presents a task that requires very diverse and unique behavior from a Reflexion agent.\\n0.0\\n0.5\\n1.0\\n1.5\\n2.0\\n2.5\\n3.0\\nTrial Number\\n0.10\\n0.15\\n0.20\\n0.25\\n0.30\\n0.35\\n0.40\\n0.45\\n0.50\\nProportion of Solved Environments\\nWebShop Success Rate\\nReAct only\\nReAct + Reflexion\\nFigure 6: Reflexion vs React performance on WebShop across 100 customer shopping requests.\\nReAct + Reflexion fails to significantly outperform ReAct.\\nC\\nProgramming\\nProgramming LLM calls require strict instructions to produce function bodies only, due to the\\nextensive dialogue training of the LLMs. A few programming examples are reported below with\\ninstructions highlighted in blue and templates.

models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to interact with exter- nal environments (e.g., games, compilers, APIs) as goal-driven agents. However, it remains challenging for these language agents to quickly and efficiently learn from trial-and-error as traditional reinforcement learning methods require exten- sive training samples and expensive model fine-tuning. We propose Reflexion, a novel framework to reinforce language agents not by updating weights, but in- stead through linguistic feedback. Concretely, Reflexion agents verbally reflect on task feedback signals, then maintain their own reflective text in an episodic memory buffer to induce better decision-making in subsequent trials. Reflexion is flexible enough to incorporate various types (scalar values or free-form language) and sources (external or internally simulated) of feedback signals, and obtains significant improvements over a baseline agent across diverse tasks (sequential decision-making, coding, language reasoning). For example, Reflexion achieves a 91% pass@1 accuracy on the HumanEval coding benchmark, surpassing the previ- ous state-of-the-art GPT-4 that achieves 80%. We also conduct ablation and analysis studies using different feedback signals, feedback incorporation methods, and agent types, and provide insights into how they affect performance.

This self-reflective feedback acts as a ‘semantic’ gradient signal by providing the agent with a concrete direction to improve upon, helping it learn from prior mistakes to perform better on the task. This is akin to how humans iteratively learn to accomplish complex tasks in a few-shot manner – by reflecting on their previous failures in order to form an improved plan of attack for the next attempt.

Given a sparse reward signal, such as a binary success status (success/fail), the current trajectory, and its persistent memory mem, the self-reflection model generates nuanced and specific feedback. This feedback, which is more informative than scalar rewards, is then stored in the agent’s memory (mem). For instance, in a multi-step decision-making task, when the agent receives a failure signal, it can infer that a specific action ai led to subsequent incorrect actions ai+1 and ai+2. The agent can then verbally state that it should have taken a different action, a′ i+1 and a′ i+2, and store this experience in its memory. In subsequent trials, the agent can leverage its past experiences to adapt its decision-making approach at time t by choosing action a′ i.

Following Yao et al. [30], we run the agent in 134 AlfWorld environments across six different tasks, including finding hidden objects (e.g., finding a spatula in a drawer), moving objects (e.g., moving a knife to the cutting board), and manipulating objects with other objects (e.g., chilling a tomato in the fridge). We use ReAct [30] as the action generator as Yao et al. [30] has shown success in long trajectory decision- making using explicit intermediate thoughts. AlfWorld tasks naturally require a self-evaluation step as the environment can only signal if a task is complete. To achieve fully autonomous behavior, we implement two self-evaluation techniques: natural language classification using an LLM and a hand-written heuristic. The heuristic is simple: if the agent executes the same action and receives the same response for more than 3 cycles, or if the number of actions taken in the current environment exceeds 30 (inefficient planning), we self-reflect. In the baseline runs, if self-reflection is suggested, we skip the self-reflection process, reset the environment, and start a new trial. In the Reflexion runs, the agent uses self-reflection to find its mistake, update its memory, reset the environment, and start a new trial. To avoid very long prompt windows that may exceed the maximum limit, we truncate the agent’s memory to the last 3 self-reflections (experiences).'), Document(metadata={'source': '../datas/Reflexion.pdf', 'coordinates': {'points': ((107.691, 590.2033216), (107.691, 621.9839216), (505.24318271680005, 621.9839216), (505.24318271680005, 590.2033216)), 'system': 'PixelSpace', 'layout_width': 612.0, 'layout_height': 792.0}, 'file_directory': '../datas', 'filename': 'Reflexion.pdf', 'last_modified': '2026-01-19T16:10:40', 'links': [{'text': '30', 'url': 'cite.yao2023react', 'start_index': 153}], 'page_number': 5, 'languages': ['eng'], 'filetype': 'application/pdf', 'parent_id': 'bdd408a217bea1dd4b7bb58939b64565', 'category': 'NarrativeText', 'element_id': '46984d6a428a614f43ae2b8b178d6550'}, page_content='To avoid syntactic errors, we provide two domain-specific few-shot trajectories to the agent.

Naturally, the CoT (GT) achieved higher accuracy scores as it was given access to the ground truth context of the question.

Recall that CoT (GT) uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning with provided ground truth context, which tests reasoning ability over long contexts. Next, we add an element of episodic memory (EPM) by including the most recent trajectory. For the Reflexion agent, we implement the standard self-reflection step as a final pass. Intuitively, we test if the agent is iteratively learning more effectively by using verbal explanation using language written in the first person. 4 shows that self-reflection improves learning by an 8% absolute boost over the episodic memory learning advantage.

Therefore, in the case in which the model generates a flaky test suite, it is possible that all tests pass on an incorrect solution and lead to a false positive label on a code completion [11]. On the other hand, if the model produces an incorrectly written test suite, it is possible for some of the tests to fail on a correct solution, leading to a self-reflection generation that is conditioned on a false negative code completion. Given the implementation of Reflexion, false negatives are preferred over false positives as the agent may be able to use self-reflection to identify the incorrect test(s) and prompt itself to keep the original code completion intact. On the other hand, if an invalid test suite returns a false positive completion (all internal test cases pass but the implementation is incorrect), the agent will prematurely report an invalid submission. In 2, various conditions are measured to analyze performance beyond pass@1 accuracy. Previously, we displayed the inferior performance of Reflexion to the baseline GPT-4 on MBPP Python. In 2, we observe a notable discrepancy between the false positive labels produced by internal test execution, P(not pass@1 generation correct | tests pass). That is, the probability that a submission will fail given that it passes all unit tests. For HumanEval and MBPP Python, the baseline pass@1 accuracies are relatively similar, 82% and 80%, respectively. However, the false positive test execution rate for MBPP Python is 16.3% while the rate for HumanEval Python is a mere 1.4%, leading to 91% overall accuracy 1.'), Document(metadata={'source': '../datas/Reflexion.pdf', 'coordinates': {'points': ((145.758, 471.3875834), (145.758, 481.3501834), (187.949611, 481.3501834), (187.949611, 471.3875834)), 'system': 'PixelSpace', 'layout_width': 612.0, 'layout_height': 792.0}, 'file_directory': '../datas', 'filename': 'Reflexion.pdf', 'last_modified': '2026-01-19T16:10:40', 'page_number': 8, 'languages': ['eng'], 'filetype': 'application/pdf', 'category': 'Title', 'element_id': '2bed2ec1eb9188782ec2e028e81b9365'}, page_content='Approach'), Document(metadata={'source': '../datas/Reflexion.pdf', 'coordinates': {'points': ((257.189681, 471.3875834), (257.189681, 481.3501834), (325.1744634000001, 481.3501834), (325.1744634000001, 471.3875834)), 'system': 'PixelSpace', 'layout_width': 612.0, 'layout_height': 792.0}, 'file_directory': '../datas', 'filename': 'Reflexion.pdf', 'last_modified': '2026-01-19T16:10:40', 'page_number': 8, 'languages': ['eng'], 'filetype': 'application/pdf', 'category': 'Title', 'element_id': '3e71b7634297e865a7a8c1aa4e1637c9'}, page_content='Test Generation'), Document(metadata={'source': '../datas/Reflexion.pdf', 'coordinates': {'points': ((337.12958340000006, 471.3875834), (337.12958340000006, 481.3501834), (466.2448794, 481.3501834), (466.2448794, 471.3875834)), 'system': 'PixelSpace', 'layout_width': 612.0, 'layout_height': 792.0}, 'file_directory': '../datas', 'filename': 'Reflexion.pdf', 'last_modified': '2026-01-19T16:10:40', 'page_number': 8, 'languages': ['eng'], 'filetype': 'application/pdf', 'category': 'Title', 'element_id': '539141cc4c130fb3a5ba84f3853761d2'}, page_content='Self-reflection Pass@1 (Acc)'), Document(metadata={'source': '../datas/Reflexion.pdf', 'coordinates': {'points': ((145.758, 487.57132160000003), (145.758, 530.1921834), (245.234561, 530.1921834), (245.234561, 487.57132160000003)), 'system': 'PixelSpace', 'layout_width': 612.0, 'layout_height': 792.0}, 'file_directory': '../datas', 'filename': 'Reflexion.pdf', 'last_modified': '2026-01-19T16:10:40', 'page_number': 8, 'languages': ['eng'], 'filetype': 'application/pdf', 'category': 'Title', 'element_id': '1c8473b98552a1c0c8f4497802365383'}, page_content='Base model Test generation omission Self-reflection omission Reflexion'), Document(metadata={'source': '../datas/Reflexion.pdf', 'coordinates': {'points': ((257.188, 487.57132160000003), (257.188, 530.2619216), (278.07129060000005, 530.2619216), (278.07129060000005, 487.57132160000003)), 'system': 'PixelSpace', 'layout_width': 612.0, 'layout_height': 792.0}, 'file_directory': '../datas', 'filename': 'Reflexion.pdf', 'last_modified': '2026-01-19T16:10:40', 'page_number': 8, 'languages': ['eng'], 'filetype': 'application/pdf', 'category': 'Title', 'element_id': '7dbc6d4c8646f6856f03296ac1de4681'}, page_content='False False True True'), Document(metadata={'source': '../datas/Reflexion.pdf', 'coordinates': {'points': ((337.1279024, 487.57132160000003), (337.1279024, 530.2619216), (358.01119300000005, 530.2619216), (358.01119300000005, 487.57132160000003)), 'system': 'PixelSpace', 'layout_width': 612.0, 'layout_height': 792.0}, 'file_directory': '../datas', 'filename': 'Reflexion.pdf', 'last_modified': '2026-01-19T16:10:40', 'page_number': 8, 'languages': ['eng'], 'filetype': 'application/pdf', 'category': 'Title', 'element_id': 'e35e7384dd93fea4155d11590c23d145'}, page_content='False True False True'), Document(metadata={'source': '../datas/Reflexion.pdf', 'coordinates': {'points': ((408.111, 487.57132160000003), (408.111, 530.1921834), (425.5476584, 530.1921834), (425.5476584, 487.57132160000003)), 'system': 'PixelSpace', 'layout_width': 612.0, 'layout_height': 792.0}, 'file_directory': '../datas', 'filename': 'Reflexion.pdf', 'last_modified': '2026-01-19T16:10:40', 'page_number': 8, 'languages': ['eng'], 'filetype': 'application/pdf', 'parent_id': 'e35e7384dd93fea4155d11590c23d145', 'category': 'UncategorizedText', 'element_id': 'a92d873be0d4abbb2790634d4a6a9017'}, page_content='0.60 0.52 0.60 0.68'), Document(metadata={'source': '../datas/Reflexion.pdf', 'coordinates': {'points': ((107.691, 533.7983216), (107.691, 554.6699216), (504.0032279999999, 554.6699216), (504.0032279999999, 533.7983216)), 'system': 'PixelSpace', 'layout_width': 612.0, 'layout_height': 792.0}, 'file_directory': '../datas', 'filename': 'Reflexion.pdf', 'last_modified': '2026-01-19T16:10:40', 'page_number': 8, 'languages': ['eng'], 'filetype': 'application/pdf', 'parent_id': 'e35e7384dd93fea4155d11590c23d145', 'category': 'NarrativeText', 'element_id': '65fcaebbefdc8d60f21ed7e64d4f59c9'}, page_content='Table 3: Pass@1 accuracy for various compromised approaches on the Reflexion approach using GPT-4 as the base model on HumanEval Rust -

We observe this shortcoming in an experiment on WebShop [29]. WebShop is a web-based problem-solving benchmark that tests agents to navigate an e-commerce website to locate and purchase products given requests from clients. We test a two-shot ReAct + Reflexion agent in 100 environments. However, after only four trials, we terminate the runs as the agent does not show signs of improvement 6. Further, the agent does not generate helpful, intuitive self-reflections after failed attempts. We conclude that Reflexion is unable to solve tasks that require a significant amount of diversity and exploration. In AlfWorld, the agent is able to adequately explore new environments because the permissible actions can be seen in the observations. In HotPotQA, the agent faces a similar WebShop search query task but is more successful as the search space for Wikipedia articles is more diverse and requires less precise search queries. A common problem for e-commerce search engines is properly handling ambiguity in natural language search interpretations.
